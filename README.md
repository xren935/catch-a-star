# NPM-Star 
Being interested in astrophysics enthusiast, I appreciate the fact that we can just look up at the sky as a way of looking back in time 👀💫. Ever wondered if there's a SpaceX satellite orbitting around you? Try out NPM-Star! (bonus points if you know what's behind the name). <br />

NPM-Star is a web app that uses real-time data(https://docs.spacexdata.com/) to visualize star tracks.  <br />
Simply enter the geolocation of the place you want to inspect and specify how long you want the animation to last, and you'll be able choose satellites from all the available ones and see them moving on the world map.
